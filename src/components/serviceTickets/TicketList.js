//1. Tried fetching tickets again- fetched them but didn't re-render
//2. Tried wrapping tickets map in a useEffect- didn't render any tickets at all
//3. Tried calling whole TicketList function in a useEffect- useEffect cannot be at top level
//4. Tried wrapping whole JSX portion in a function then calling that in a useEffect, couldn't access the funtion before initialization
//5. Tried wrapping a useEffect around the whole JSX function, many errors resulted
//6. Tried invoking TicketList in deleteTicket, many errors resulted
//7. Tried to do "history.push("/tickets") in a few different places- seemingly did nothing
//8. Tried doing some nonsense on the ApplicationViews module
